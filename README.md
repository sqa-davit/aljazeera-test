# Project info
NodeJS version v22.13.1 <br>
CodeceptJS uses WebdriverIO <br>
Page object model with BDD <br>
For reporting used Allure report <br>
for running all tests need to use  <br> `npm install` <br>  `npx codeceptjs run --features` <br>

## Project improvment & Solutions
Before and after hooks <br>
Browser managment (network listeners, storage, cache etc...) <br>
Good reporting (Videos, Screenshots, send notification) <br>
Base BDD step definations <br>
There are a lot of things missing in simple framework
Need to have strategy for steps sentences format 

# Note
it's just simple example <br>
Not bad solution having wrapper CodeceptJS
